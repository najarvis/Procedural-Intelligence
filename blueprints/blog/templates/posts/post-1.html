<h2 class="blog-post-title">College Courses and Learning. Oh Right, and an Intro.</h2>

<p>So this is what it is like to have a blog? Seems pretty neat so far I guess. I can't imagine anyone would want to read my thoughts or my opinions, but hey, I hear all the cool kids do
these, so why shouldn't I? </p>

<p>Enough cringe out of the way, I'm not really sure what I want to write about here. I guess I want to talk about what I find interesting, because that is what I will end up being able to enjoy
writing about. I guess a little bit about myself would be helpful. My name is Nick Jarvis and I am a first year Computer Science student at Miami University in Oxford. Being taught Computer Science is such a weird concept for me. To explain this, first I need to tell a little backstory.</p>

<p>I started programming when I was around 13 years old in 8th grade or so. Like any young nerdy boy I loved playing video games, specifically Lego: Star Wars and Age of Empires 2. My dad noticed I was playing a lot of games, so he started telling me about how in college he would make games on his ancient computer and show them to his friends. I was hooked. The idea of	designing my own games and being able to create whatever I wanted sounded amazing, even if it wasn't as 'fun' as trying to max out the amount of studs I had in the various Lego games.</p>

<p>I started off with a website called "Programming for the Complete N00B." It was a very basic intro to programming with Python. I went through the first few tutorials which explained the idea of how to print out stuff, what a variable is, the while loop, and the idea of list statements. I had also been a Ninja for the past 2 halloweens, so I decided that I knew enough to make my own game! I spent the next 2 weeks with only basic knowledge of the 4 things listed above, and created a program called "Ninja Assassin." Super creative, I know. It was ~700 lines of uncommented line after uncommented line of if statements and long while statements that let you play as a warrior who must defeat the EVIL SAMURI KING. You basically just fought random enemies that didn't really scale or pose any challenge until you were a high enough level to defeat him. Anyone else crossing their fingers for the HD remaster reveal this E3?</p>

<p>It wasn't impressive by any stretch of the imagination, but to me, having something that I made and that I could show my dad was a feeling that I'll never forget. After that I just started working on new projects where I would try to implement something and have to figure out myself how to implement it. That's how I went through all of high school, starting a programming club with my friend so we could show what programming is about to those who might not experience it (our school offered no computer classes). Even in that club we didn't really take a formal teaching approach, we more tried to focus on individual projects if possible.</p>

<p>So now in college sitting in a lecture for 2 hours twice a week is just an odd experience. I just type in exactly what the professor says, and the only things that determines if my code works are if the professor had it working when they typed it and if my fingers could keep up with the lesson. I'm not saying I have a bad teacher, just that the experience itself is different. For me I feel a more appropriate learning environment would be one where the professors ask me to complete a project and I have to learn how to complete it on your own (though I understand this would not work for all students).</p>

<p>So now it is 1:40 in the morning and I am just rambling on a site that doesn't even exist yet. Perhaps I'll put it up tomorrow, or this blog will forever stay off the internet like a sculptor making his own art in his basement that is just for him own enjoyment. Regardless, I need sleep. Perhaps I'll post tomorrow, perhaps never.</p>

<p>Until then, keep learning.</p>
