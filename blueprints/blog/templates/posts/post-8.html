<h2 class="blog-post-title">First Day Abroad! Nothing is Ever as Easy as it Looks.</h2><p class="blog-post-meta">Posted on: 5/19/2017</p><p>So today Nick Wayne, Peter Hayes, and I set off on our trip to Italy for our 4 week study abroad! Unfortunately right out of the gate we ran into problems.</p><p></p><p>First off, our connecting flight got delayed 3 hours, which meant we would certainly miss our flight from JFK to Rome. We got some help and a staff member was able to get us to our destination by flying us from Cincinnati to Atlanta to Amsterdam to Rome. Awesome job on his part getting us these tickets and seats, but unfortunately it added about 12 hours to our flight plan (factoring in all the new layovers). </p><p></p><p>Getting to Atlanta was pretty easy, nothing exciting, however the flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam was rough, not to mention it left at 11:40 at night. On the plus side we got to fly in a 777 and rewatch Inception. On the downside I think I got about 2 hours of sleep on a 7.5 hour flight, during which I had planned to sleep more like 5-6. We land in Amsterdam with a few hour layover, grab some Kinder, and before long we are on our flight on our way to Rome. </p><p></p><p>I slept about the whole 3 hours, which is good because it made up for a bit of the last flight. When we landed we grabbed our bags and bought our train tickets and were about to board the train to Rome when we were told they simply weren't running and they had no idea when they would be running.</p><p></p><p>Okay.</p><p></p><p>So we go back outside and someone offers to drive us (kind of a taxi but it was filled with like 5 other people and cost 20 Euros per person). After an exhilarating drive (in which I remembered why I hate driving / being driven so much), we got dropped off outside an large poorly illuminated old door. Turns out we weren't staying in a large hostel, but rather more of an apartment, which some locals showed us how to buzz in and get up to the room. The nice lady running the hostels didn't speak very much English at all, but we managed to get everything figured out and paid for.</p><p></p><p>Obviously first things first I go for a quick run, much to the dismay of the others.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards Peter took a shower and went to bed, while Nick Wayne and I went to a little restaurant down the street and had a really nice quick dinner with authentic Italian Pasta. </p><p></p><p>Now I'm writing this before going to bed, tomorrow we head off at 0926 to Calabria by train after meeting up with the rest of the Miami students. I'll try to write most nights, as long as there is something to write about. Until then, I need to get some sleep.</p>
