<h2 class="blog-post-title">First Day of Class!</h2><p class="blog-post-meta">Posted on: 5/22/2017</p><p>I guess that nap yesterday was a really bad idea, I probably got about an hour of sleep last night. After heading to the breakfast place and getting a â‚¬0.70 croissant I knew I could take on the day.</p><p></p><p>We met up with Professor Krumpe at the building we toured yesterday and after a few minutes our guide promptly showed us to our room where we will be having classes. Each of the buildings kind of look the same, so I was worried that we would have issues finding the classroom later, but it wasn't that big of a problem. </p><p></p><p>The first class of the day is our logic programming course, in which today we simply discussed the types of things we would be using, as well as some interactive BASIC programming. Because of the late start and talking to faculty the class was pretty short, and before long we were onto food!</p><p></p><p>For lunch we got a ticket that allowed us up to five 'points', in which the main course is two points and everything else (except bread) is one point. I got a huge slice of pizza, carrots, pear juice, 2 pieces of bread, and yogurt. A very good meal I have no complaints about. Everything here is fresh, and ironically all the bread is hard (though it still seems very fresh).</p><p></p><p>After lunch we had our Ethics class, which was a lot more interesting. We talked a lot about some moral dilemmas we are facing as a society, for example self driving cars being programmed to kill and harassment in virtual reality. The discussions were very thought provoking and it was really interesting to see other people's ideas or points behind them. </p><p></p><p>For dinner we all went to Bistro, and had an amazing dinner. We ordered a ton of food and even got free dessert from the staff: Marshmallow-stuffed crust pizza with Nutella and M&M toppings... YUM. </p><p></p><p>Now I'm back in the dorm writing this and doing some homework, waiting for my stomach to settle down so I can go for a run. At first I was a little unsure about this place, but the longer I'm here the more I like it. Weather and views always seem so amazing. Tomorrow we head to Costanza, then Thursday we head to Tropea so I'm pretty excited about that.</p><p></p><p>I'm going to try to get some pictures in the blog, I'll probably work on that tonight and tomorrow. I've got some really cool ones (though most of them are just of all the amazing food here).</p><p></p><p>Addio!</p>
