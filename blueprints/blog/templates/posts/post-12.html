<h2 class="blog-post-title">Three Days of Absolutely Nothing</h2><p class="blog-post-meta">Posted on: 5/29/2017</p><p>So for the past three days we have spent our time in Tropea on the beach, and that's pretty much it.</p><p></p><p>Thursday after class we caught a train down, walked about 20 minutes to where we were staying, and after putting our stuff in our rooms we headed to the beach, which was about a 45 second walk. We proceeded to spend the entire weekend on the beach, only moving off to eat at the restaurant on the beach, or to go to sleep. </p><p></p><p>We found a cliff that was maybe 20 feet up over the water and had some fun jumping off, and when I get back I'll post the GoPro footage I took, which including shots of watching people jump off, holding the GoPro and jumping off, and even a cool underwater shot.</p><p></p><p>At night when the sun went down we played Euchre and just sat listening to the water come in and out. Since I didn't have WiFi or mobile signal I actually had time to think, which was perhaps more relaxing than sitting on the beach or swimming in the clear water. </p><p></p><p>I felt almost a bit lost without any structure to the day, but I guess a change of pace is good every once in a while. I'm sorry I don't have more to say, the weekend really was focused on doing absolutely nothing. I've posted some pictures in the <a href="/gallery">gallery</a>, and I've optimized the page so it should load faster, so definitely check those out. Next weekend we are headed to the Amalfi Coast, so that will definitely be more of the same. But for now, I'm glad to get back to at least some format to the day.</p>
