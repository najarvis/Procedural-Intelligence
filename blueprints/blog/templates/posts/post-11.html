<h2 class="blog-post-title">Everything is tired</h2><p class="blog-post-meta">Posted on: 5/24/2017</p><p>I am writing this after class on Wednesday, but this is pretty much all about Tuesday and by the end of it I'm sure you will see why I was a too exhausted to do this then.</p><p></p><p>So Tuesday's class sessions were pretty normal. We actually got to do some programming in the logic class with the language Logo, which was basically just using commands to make art. We had some puzzles / challenges to go through, which were interesting. Our second class was going to be held in Cosenza though, the city in which the rest of the day would be held.</p><p></p><p>After a quick lunch we dropped off our stuff at the dorms and went to the bus stop. After a bit of confusion we managed to get on the right bus and got off when Professor Krumpe "liked what he saw around us." Everything was old and beautiful at the same time. We kind of ambled our way towards the older-looking part of the city, with no plan in the slightest. </p><p></p><p>As we were looking for an old church Professor Krumpe found on his phone, we got berated at in Italian by an older man, afterward we just kind of stood there shaking our heads and wishing we didn't see him the rest of the trip. Once we found the church, it was pretty cool. Very old and massive. What amazed me was how it seemed like we were tourists just walking in the back yards of some of the people here. </p><p></p><p><img src="/static/images/20170523_143307.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 500px;"></p><p></p><p>We saw a small alleyway that led to some stairs and we thought we could get a cool picture in there, but once we realized the stairs kept going we followed them.</p><p></p><p><img src="/static/images/20170523_150356.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 500px;"></p><p></p><p>And followed them, and followed them, and followed them.</p><p></p><p>We climbed probably 300+ feet in stairs on what felt like some people's property, but no one else came out to yell at us. Suddenly we came out at the top to a view of the entire city. Looking down we could see the top of the 'huge' church 100 or so feet below us.</p><p></p><p><img src="/static/images/20170523_144941.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 500px;"></p><p></p><p>After some pictures we decided the best way to get back down was all those stairs, which definitely wasn't as bad as on the way up, but by the end we were all pretty tired and hot. We explore in the old town for a little while longer until we stop at a fountain all dehydrated and tired while Professor Krumpe checks his phone and determines the best course of action is to head in the opposite direction back to the newer part of the city. We grab Gelato at a local place and split up, with a plan to meet back up for dinner.</p><p></p><p>It's 4:00, dinner won't be until after 7:30 and all we want to do is lay down and take a nap. A group of 4 or 5 split off and head to the park, in which we naturally get on the merry-go-round for children (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Tift_Park_merry-go-round.JPG/330px-Tift_Park_merry-go-round.JPG">This</a>) to make us even more tired and dizzy than before. After chilling in the shade in the park we meander to the main street and slowly make our way along it.</p><p></p><p>At one point after perusing a toy store and a supermarket we seriously consider watching King Arthur in the local theater until dinner time, but decide against it because that would be wasting the opportunity given to us. We walk a bit longer, I pick up a SIM card so I can actually use my phone finally, and we met back up with one of the other groups in a store selling 'chips', which are just super tasty french fries. Decided since we still had over an hour until dinner we would get some, and they were amazing. </p><p></p><p>One of the other guys and I decided to check for food places around the place where we were, long story short it was sketch and we found next to nothing. The group just decides to sit and wait where we were until it was time to meet up. Finally we head back to the park to meet up with the rest of the groups and head to dinner.</p><p></p><p>We got dinner at a nice restaurant off the street we were on earlier, in which most of us had the recommended house spaghetti, which was a potato, ham, tomato, and pasta dish.</p><p></p><p><img src="/static/images/20170523_200855.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 500px;"></p><p></p><p>For dessert I got a cup of tiramisu and ice cream with cookie bits in it. I regret to say I forgot to take a picture of it until the moment I put that last bite in my mouth. You're just going to have to take my word for it, it was to die for.</p><p></p><p>It took a while to get our checks, and we were worried we were going to miss the bus, but in the end we made it with a few minutes to spare and were quickly on our way home. I knew I still needed to get my run in for the night, but with eating so late I was pretty worried. I decided to go out at 10:45, which was about an hour and a half after finishing food. Peter didn't want to go with me, which I can't blame him for. I ran 2 laps around the campus, for a total of 4 miles. The first lap wasn't so bad, but by the end my stomach was really complaining and I spent the evening sick. </p><p></p><p>Today I am feeling much better, and am pretty much relaxing. Tomorrow we head to our first weekend-trip, Tropea. We will spend Thursday through Saturday and come back Sunday. Not quite sure what the plan is, but I'm pretty excited.</p><p></p><p>But now, it's time to take a nap. </p>
