<h2 class="blog-post-title">Day 2 & 3 Combo Deal</h2><p class="blog-post-meta">Posted on: 5/21/2017</p><p><b>Day 2</b></p><p></p><p>So I am writing this Sunday evening because yesterday we got back pretty late and I pretty much fell asleep right away. Last two days have been cool but exhausting.</p><p></p><p>On Saturday we got up and left around 8, and since last night the lady who ran the hostel gave us a voucher for a free pastry and coffee at a small local shop we stopped there first. Authentic Italian pastry, Cappuccino, and even a glass of pomegranate juice they gave us. Delicious! ...and pretty much the only thing we would eat that day. </p><p></p><p>We met up with the rest of the group and made it to the train station, punched our tickets, and we were off. The train was long but pretty scenic. I got my GoPro out to take a timelapse but it died about a third of the way through the trip, right as it started to get really nice. I slept and read for most of the trip. After a quick stop at another train station and another 10 minute train we were in Rende. I wasn't quite sure what to expect but it was quite quaint. </p><p></p><p>We took a bus to Socrates, and it because pretty clear just how steep the hill we will have to climb to get back from town each day. We get dropped off near the bottom of a hill near the Socrates dorms, the ones we are staying in, then we got to climb up said super steep hill to the actual buildings, which has become quite the experience to go up and down every day multiple times per day. We got our rooms and unpacked a bit, but as everyone was hungry from not eating since the morning (this was probably 5 or so) we decided to go out and find something for 'lunch'. </p><p></p><p>Apparently during the day most places close for 'siesta', which is something like a short nap in the middle of the day. This meant almost no where was open save for this nice little pizza place at the bottom of the hill. Turns out almost none of us speak Italian so ordering food comes down to a lot of pointing and smiling, which gets the job done most of the time.</p><p></p><p>After lunch we explore the city a little bit, finding a grocery store and some other small shops, and after grabbing some detergent from the shop we once again head back up the hill to the dorms, knowing full well in about an hour or so we were going back out for dinner. Our calves are going to be unmatched by the end of this...</p><p></p><p>I went for a quick 2 mile run, and decided to go the opposite way of town to see if it levels out at all or if there was anything else there. Turns out it's just uphill, seemingly forever. That's pretty neat. Guess ol' Glosser isn't going to even slow me down when I get back.</p><p></p><p>For dinner we walked down to a place in town called Rossopomodoro, a sit down place that focused on Pizza but had plenty of options, everything looking delicious. I decided to try the 'classic' fried pizza, which turned out to be if a funnel cake and an Italian margarita pizza had a baby. Delicious by all standards. Afterwards I ordered bebé, a tiramisu with Nutella and fudge desert. I took a bite and it was probably the most amazing combination of sweet and rich I have ever tasted.</p><p></p><p>After dinner we split up with some of us heading to the bowling place across the street, in which the actual bowling part was closed, but we played pool and ping pong until about 1:20. After a half hour walk back we arrived at the room at around 2 and I pretty much hit the pillow and was out.</p><p></p><p><b>Day 3</b></p><p></p><p>Fast forward 12 hours of sleeping and it's 2 PM, and time to go see the campus, the point of this trip. The campus is really cool and is essentially a really long walkway built vertically. It's about a mile long and in most places probably 4-6 stories, with buildings flanking each side the whole way down. We found the building we would be having class in, but even as of now we don't know the specific building. </p><p></p><p>We walked about another 20 minutes past the campus to a little pizza shop to see if we could grab something to eat, only to find it closed and us sitting there hungry and about a 40 minute walk from town or the campus. We walk into town to grab something to eat, only to find pretty much everything is closed mid day on a Sunday. Eventually we find a Kebab shop open and I'm not sure if it was the fact that I hadn't eating in 17 hours or the food itself but it was so, so, so good. €5.25 for a giant lamb, lettuce, peppers, and onion wrap with a drink was fantastic. Everything is so cheap but so good here.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards we grabbed Gelato at a small place, €1.50 for two scoops (what a steal!) and I got Kinder Bueno (of which I have been eating probably more than I should...) and something very similar to Almond Joy flavors. After Gelato we headed back up the mountain and I crashed in bed and fell asleep for another few hours.</p><p></p><p>Waking up around 9:30 I realized I hadn't ran yet, so I quickly got dressed and ran down around the campus (which is actually quite flat for that mile that it stretches!) I can see myself doing a lot of my running around here. Got in a little over 2 miles, and after getting back and showering I am writing this. </p><p></p><p>These past few days have been fun, but I am looking forward to getting into more of a routine. I'm pretty much always tired, but I think that's a combination of jet lag and climbing all these hills constantly. I might not write each day or even about each day, but I will keep the interesting or exciting moments here. </p><p></p><p>Until next time, Ciao!</p>
