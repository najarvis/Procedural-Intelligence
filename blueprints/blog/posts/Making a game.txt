<strike><p>I started work on a game <a href="#"><strike>here</strike></a> (as a disclaimer, I am also using that page for testing, so it will change many timese), though right now it is just squares that bounce around your screen. I have an idea though for a game that would allow people to all watch artificial creatures evolve with genetic algorithms, because that stuff is cool and that's one of the reasons this website is called what it is. Once I draw up some more schematics or have some more solid ideas I'll post them here.</p></strike>
<p>That game didn't make it very far, so...</p>
